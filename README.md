# Controller 🚨

This app is the client for my [rotaryboard][rotaryboard] to integrates it with various things I use:

- foobar2000 🎵 - playback & volume control
- Mattermost - notifications about messages in the primary channel we use at work and about private messages
- IRC (via [NotHub][nothub] and a script in my IRC client which is too ugly to publish) - notifies me about
  messages in certain channels, private messages, and messages associated with a bot posting Git commits
- Button to switch screens to standby (and back on) 🖥
- Button to lock the desktop 🔒 (no free 🥐 for my colleagues!)
- Turning off numlock when locking the PC (annoying red light at night 🌙), and back on after unlocking
